# Exercise 3: Advanced Features

Implement advanced Liquibase features:
1. Use preconditions to check if changes are needed
2. Implement context-dependent changes
3. Create and use custom SQL
4. Add table indexes for optimization

## Success Criteria
- Preconditions work as expected
- Changes apply correctly in different contexts
- Custom SQL executes successfully
- Performance improvements are measurable
